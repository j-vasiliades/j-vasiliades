## Hi there 👋

# Julia Vasiliades  
**Industrial Engineering | Northeastern University (B.S. ’27)**  
**Operations Research • Manufacturing • Robotics • Optimization**

I am an Industrial Engineering student at Northeastern University with strong interests in **operations research, advanced manufacturing, optimization modeling, robotics, and supply chain systems**. My academic and project work focuses on translating analytical methods into real engineering outcomes—from linear programming models and production planning to CAD/CAM and industrial robotics.

I also work closely with real-world construction and manufacturing operations through multi-year roles at Olympic Marketing Group, giving me hands-on experience with project management, vendor coordination, scheduling, and process improvement.

## Selected Academic Projects
### **Falcon Die Casting Company (FDC) – Multi-Week Production Planning**
- Built Python optimization models (PuLP + HiGHS/CBC) to minimize overtime, balance machine loads, integrate setup times, and satisfy weekly demand across 5+ parts and multi-machine environments.  
- Developed week-by-week and all-weeks LP models with full documentation.

### **Industrial Robotics (Octopuz + FANUC/UR10/KUKA)**
- Programmed welding paths, multi-pass stitching, part transfer, collision avoidance, and tool/frame calibration.  
- Designed automated sequences using sensors, positioners, and timing logic.

### **CAD/CAM & CNC Manufacturing**
- Designed components in Fusion 360, generated toolpaths for milling/turning, and evaluated surface quality & orientation effects.

### **Additive Manufacturing Prototype**
- Created multiple iterations of a custom robot-mounted Sharpie holder; evaluated print orientation errors, support interference, and tolerance behavior.
